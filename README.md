The **Meal Management System** is a web-based application built using **.NET MVC**, designed for managing shared mess environments — such as student hostels, bachelors’ housing, or family mess. It allows users to input meals, admins to record expenses, and automatically calculates per-meal costs and member-wise breakdowns.
